                    I’m Patricio Gustavo, but most people just call me Pato.  I am a professional commercial and editorial photographer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

                    I left *** in 2009 for what I thought would be a year abroad. But here I am, more than a decade later, still happily living and working in ***. I gradually adjusted to city living and feel privileged to have spent a large chunk of my adult life in some of the most vibrant metropolises in the world. Still, I remain a country boy at heart, more comfortable splashing barefoot in creeks than surrounded by concrete. 

                    Though based in ***, I am available for editorial, commercial, portrait, documentary, and travel photography assignments worldwide. Whether you are in need of lifestyle photography for a major hotel brand, a unique take for an upcoming fashion campaign, or reportage from remote lands, I’m ready to tackle any project you have in the pipeline. Take a look at an overview of my work, browse my essays, or visit my photo journal to get a sense of my photographic style. If you like what you see, give me a shout and let me know how I can help out.

                    My editorial photography is frequently featured in a variety of international and domestic publications. I also work as a commercial photographer with some of the world’s leading brands. A shortlist of my clients includes:

                    The New York Times, Hugo Boss, Lenovo, Capital One, Wired Magazine, The Four Seasons, The Wall Street Journal, AMC Networks, Government of Japan, San Francisco Chronicle, Condé Nast Traveler, DBS Bank, Yanmar, InterContinental Hotels Group, Tatler Homes, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, GEO Special, House and Garden, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Afar, Swiss Energy Foundation, CAA Magazine, Ink Global, Financial Times, Grand Seiko, Adweek, Travel + Leisure, and more.

                    I don’t solely identify as a photographer. I am also a father, husband, lover of fried food, and a relatively decent human. 

                    Let’s create something together. Be in touch.
